# fastpca
Fast principal component analysis for very high dimensional data implemented according to C. Bishop's book "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning", p. 570. For high-dimensional data, fastpca.m is much faster than Python's in-built PCA function (from sklearn.decomposition) or MATLAB's in-build function pca.m
